By clicking “sign up” or “continue with”, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to be bound by these Terms as well as our House Rules and Privacy Policy, which are all incorporated by reference into this Agreement. </p>
                                <p>The access to or use of certain areas and features of the Brandcrush Platform may be subject to separate policies, standards or guidelines, or may require that you accept additional terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions applicable to a specific area or feature of the Brandcrush Platform, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your access to or use of that area or feature, unless specified otherwise.</p>
								<p>Certain Space Listings (for example, Space Listings offering Activations at organised events) may be subject to special terms and conditions (Special Terms) (for example, stricter cancellation policies) that override these Terms to the extent of any inconsistency. You will be notified on a Space Listing if Special Terms exist and be prompted to read the Special Terms before signing and submitting them to the Activation Partner for approval.</p>
								<p>Certain types of Activation Partners (for example, Event Partners) may also be subject to special terms and conditions that override these Terms to the extent of any inconsistency.

In some jurisdictions, Activation Partners must obtain a permit or licence before providing certain Activations (for example, permits and licences associated with serving liquor, offering liquor for sale, food preparation and handling, fundraising activities, providing diagnostic or health advice and broadcasting). If you require guidance or assistance with complying with the relevant laws and rules, you should contact the applicable regulatory authorities and obtain legal advice as required. </b></p>

                                            The Brandcrush Platform is an online marketplace and software that enables registered users (Members) (Members who offer services are “Activation Partners” (previously Activation Hosts) and the services they offer are “Activations”) to advertise Activations on the Brandcrush Platform (Space Listings) and to communicate and transact directly with Members who wish to book Activations (Members using Activations are “Brands”). Activations may be by way of product sampling, pop up, partnerships, sponsorships, in-location digital and print and other media activation units and experiential formats. Activations include the use by Brands of physical and digital spaces with existing foot traffic or customer reach (Activation Spaces) and may include the provision of staff to deliver a brand or product message on behalf of the brand.

Activation Partners are solely responsible for their Space Listings and Activations. When Members make or accept a booking, they are entering into a contract directly with each other. Brandcrush is not and does not become a party to, or other participant in, any contractual relationship between Members. Brandcrush is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member.

Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Brandcrush about any Member, including of the Member's identity or background or whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. You should always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to book or accept an Activation request or when communicating and interacting with other Members, whether online or in person.

Once a Brand requests a booking for an Activation, you must not request that the Brand pays a higher price than the Activation Fee quoted in the booking request. When setting your Activation Fee, Activation Partners must use best endeavours to charge fair and reasonable Activation Fees that reflect the value offered by a particular Activation having regard to the nature of the Activation. For example, Activations that involve distribution of samples as a gift with purchase or provision of a dedicated staff member may be able to charge a higher Activation Fee than a passive counter top display.

This amount represents a genuine and reasonable estimate of such costs and expenses associated with managing and processing late payments. We also reserve the right to withdraw credit facilities (where applicable) at any time or to remove your access to the Brandcrush Platform. You may also be liable to pay interest on any amount outstanding at the ATO Benchmark interest rate (Australia) on the date the payment becomes due and you may also be responsible for all reasonable expenses incurred by us as a result of such late payment (including but not limited to costs incurred by us to recover any unpaid amounts). Without limiting our rights, in the event you fail to pay any charges within the timeframe and in the manner required, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Brandcrush Platform or to suspend or terminate any current Campaigns.

                                            BE ACCURATE: Your activation description needs to be representative of what is going to happen in real life. Describe your activation and append images of your products and/or display where possible so Activation Partners can ensure that the activation is the right fit for their business.

                                            BE TIMELY: If you are arranging your own freight of products for an activation run by our Activation Partners, ensure product is delivered by the required delivery date as Activation Partners have agreed to a set date for your activation. Respond to any messages from the Activation Partner to ensure a successful activation.

                                            BE CREATIVE: Every great experiential activation starts with a creative idea and our spaces bring this idea to real life.

                                            BE COURTEOUS: If you are activating with your brand/agency team in a space, ensure you follow their ‘house’rules.

                                            BE TIMELY: Our brands are often activating these campaigns as part of a broader integrated campaign.

                                            BE A GREAT AMBASSADOR: For activations executed by our Activation Partners, ensure you take the time to read the activation description and any appended documents so that you are knowledgeable on the product/services you are promoting.
