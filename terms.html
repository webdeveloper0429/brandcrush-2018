                                            The Brandcrush Platform is an online marketplace that enables registered users (Members) (Members who offer services are “Activation Hosts” and the services they offer are “Activations”) to advertise Activations on the Brandcrush Platform (Space Listings) and to communicate and transact directly with Members who wish to book Activations (Members using Activations are “Brands”). Activations may be by way of product sampling, pop up or experiential formats and include but not be limited to gift with purchase, goody bags, counter tops, fridge displays, booths or product demonstrations. Activations include the use by Brands of physical spaces with existing foot traffic (Activation Spaces) and may include the provision of staff to deliver a brand or product message on behalf of the brand.

Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Brandcrush about any Member, including of the Member's identity or background or whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. You should always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to book or accept an Activation request or when communicating and interacting with other Members, whether online or in person.
